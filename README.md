# PhaseBeam

This is PhaseBeam which was made around Android JB/ICS and originally contained RenderScript (the OpenGL abstraction that Google chose at the time).

As the original is available at the [Android git](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/wallpapers/PhaseBeam/+/5041572599603371f09640388511a747a5894660) I chose to make a repo and convert it so I can just hit recompile if ever needed.

Right now the configuring is minimum API 9 (Gingerbread 2.3.0 â€“ 2.3.2) with target API 35 (Vanilla Ice Cream 15) (way more range than the original).
I only was able to test it with API 10 (Gingerbread (MR1) 2.3.3 - 2.3.7) and there may also be context switching issues as GLES context preservation is only available since Honeycomb (Android 3.0).

It should run on basically any Android phone out there as I explicitly let it build with all architectures (at least I think that what the setting in gradle does).

## Compilation

Just get the official Android Studio IDE and install the API level 35 SDK.
You may need to install Java 17

## Contributing

I'd love to try and optimize it a bit more but I am no Java or OpenGL man.

Please make sure if you want to contribute to test debug `.apk`'s in a local device emulator first.
